## Technical Details

### How the VBS scripts work:
1. Get the script's directory (project root)
2. Set working directory to project root
3. Execute `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` with full paths
4. Pass `--config`, `--mode` flags to the Python script
5. Run silently with no console window (`0` parameter)
6. Wait for completion (`True` parameter)

### Script parameters explained:
- `0` = Hide console window (silent mode)
- `True` = Wait for script to complete before exiting
- `--mode morning/evening` = Determines which briefing mode
- `--dry-run` = Test mode, doesn't send emails

## Editing the Scripts

If you need to modify the scripts:

1. Right-click the `.vbs` file
2. Select **Edit** (opens in Notepad)
3. Modify the command line arguments
4. Save and test

**Example modifications:**
- Change mode: Replace `--mode morning` with `--mode evening`
- Add verbose logging: Add `--verbose` flag
- Change lookback period: Add `--since 7d` flag

## Security Note

These scripts use the currently logged-in user's credentials and environment. They do NOT store passwords or API keys in the script. The `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` must be set as a system or user environment variable separately.
